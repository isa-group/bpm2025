        Most of their services run from about 6am to 11.30pm, with night buses leaving from the Prado from 12 midnight to 2am.
        For a single ride, the fare is of 1.40 euros. In case you need to make intensive use of buses or trams,
        there is also a Tarjeta Turistica (Tourist Card) valid for 1 and 3 days.
        <br />
        <br />
        You can purchase it at Tussam information stands and you can use it for all buses
        (except the special ones such as the airport bus service). It costs 5 euros for a 1-day card and 10 euros for a 3-day card.
        You’ll need to pay 1.5 euros extra that will be refunded if you return the card to a Tussam information stand.`,
