        Both services have the same fares and Tussam Cards can be used for any of them.
        Most of their services run from about 6am to 11.30pm, with night buses leaving from the Prado from 12 midnight to 2am.
        For a single ride, the fare is of 1.40 euros. In case you need to make intensive use of buses or trams,
        there is also a Tarjeta Turistica (Tourist Card) valid for 1 and 3 days.
        <br />
        <br />
        You can purchase it at Tussam information stands and you can use it for all buses
        (except the special ones such as the airport bus service). It costs 5 euros for a 1-day card and 10 euros for a 3-day card.
        You’ll need to pay 1.5 euros extra that will be refunded if you return the card to a Tussam information stand.`,
