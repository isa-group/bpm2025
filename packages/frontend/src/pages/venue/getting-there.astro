        Seville is the capital of the southern region of Spain, Andalucía.
        Therefore, it not only has its own airport but also is well connected with airports nearby such as the Malaga Airport or the Madrid Barajas Airport.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="text-2xl">
        There are many ways to arrive in Seville. There are direct flights to Seville Airport from 42 cities, many of them outside Spain,
        serving more than 15 airlines. There are also frequent connections with Madrid (MAD) and Barcelona (BCN),
        which are the main airports in Spain.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="text-2xl">
        A robust rail network connects Seville with most of other regions of Spain.
        Therefore, an alternative is flying to either Madrid (MAD) or Malaga (AGP) and then taking a train to Seville.
        There is a direct train that connects Malaga with Seville in 2 hours and a High Speed Train (AVE) that connects Madrid with Seville in less than 2:30 hours.
