## [9th International Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Business Process Management (AI4BPM)](https://sites.google.com/unitn.it/ai4bpm-2025)

Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to grow, with new and more advanced techniques and applications across numerous areas.
In the past few years, we have seen strong interest from both industry and academia in applying AI techniques
to Business Process Management (BPM). Indeed, AI is also transforming other areas where process management perspectives and techniques apply,
including industrial engineering, IoT, and emergency response, among others.
AI in BPM has been regarded as the next disruptive technology that will touch almost all business process activities currently performed by humans.
Over time, AI may lead to entirely new paradigms for business processes and operations.
The goal of this workshop is to establish a forum for researchers and professionals interested in understanding, envisioning, and discussing
the challenges and opportunities of moving from current, largely programmatic approaches for BPM to emerging forms of
AI-enabled BPM. The workshop is further enriched with a panel discussion addressing recent challenges and intersections between AI and BPM.

## [1st International Workshop on Implementation and Management of Intelligent Process Automation Solutions (AUTOMATE)](https://sites.google.com/diag.uniroma1.it/automate-2025)

The goal of AUTOMATE is to target a family of process automation techniques that combine human expertise with intelligent technologies
to enhance the execution and monitoring of business processes. Today, process automation tools range from lightweight solutions,
including centrally provisioned tools (e.g., Microsoft Power Platform), business-driven applications
(e.g., Robotic Process Automation), and user-driven solutions (e.g., ChatGPT), to more advanced solutions empowered by Artificial Intelligence (AI),
Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Large Language Models (LLMs). When combined,
these technologies unlock a new dimension of hyper-automation. This workshop aims to discuss managerial and engineering problems associated
with both lightweight and advanced process automation solutions from a Business Process Management (BPM) perspective.
After a short opening, the workshop will continue with paper presentations and discussions and close with an interactive session.
Here, participants will collaboratively develop a manifesto on challenges and best practices regarding the management and
implementation of both lightweight and advanced process automation solutions.

## [3rd Workshop on Object-centric processes from A to Z (OBJECTS)](https://sites.google.com/view/objects-workshop)

The topic of object-centric processes has been gaining momentum in the last few years, with many works addressing foundational and practical
problems on the interplay of processes and objects. Despite the surging number of results on the topic, numerous problems still require
a deeper exploration of the interplay between object data and processes. This workshop provides a platform to discuss such problems and reflect
on future directions of object-centricity in Business Process Management and Process Mining. Additionally, we plan to host a public review
session to reflect on key challenges in object-centric processes, recently identified during the BuzzOs workshop at ICPM 2024.

## [2nd. Workshop on Visual Process Analytics (VIPRA)](https://vipra-workshop.github.io/homepage/)

Over the last decades, business process management has become both increasingly data-driven and increasingly user-focused, eliciting a need to
visually present large amounts of information to support organizations in their analysis and decision-making. At the same time, the analysis questions
in the BPM field, particularly the analysis of event logs through process mining, poses new challenges and opportunities to the visualization community,
particularly the interdisciplinary design of interactive visualizations though visual analytics. In the 2nd Workshop on Visual Process Analytics (Vipra 2025),
we aim to bring together researchers from both Visual Analytics and Process Mining, to learn, create a common language, spark collaborations, and advance both fields.
The workshop provides an opportunity for participants to learn about the state-of-the-art and discuss how both fields can mutually benefit each other.
