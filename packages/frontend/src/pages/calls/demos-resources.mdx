The BPM 2025 Demos & Resources Forum showcases innovative Business Process Management (BPM) tools, services, and applications, as well as resources such as datasets, taxonomies, labelled event logs and annotated corpora alike, quantitative/qualitative data and benchmarks, that may originate either from academic initiatives or industry endeavors. The Demos & Resources Forum will provide an opportunity to present and discuss emerging technologies and relevant knowledge sources with researchers and practitioners in the field of BPM to make the community aware of the available tools and resources.

For inclusion in the proceedings, tools and resources will be evaluated on the basis of relevance to the BPM community, as well as on novelty and innovativeness. Previously demonstrated tools or exposed resources are also welcome if there is clear evidence of the value added to the previous version, such as new features, characteristics and/or the adaptation and use for new practical applications. The tools will also be evaluated based on their maturity, complexity, and robustness, such as the list of features, supported use cases, and the number and types of users. The resources will also be evaluated based on their availability, reusability, and richness, for example in terms of appropriate description (machine- or human-readable), replicability, and generalizability of the studies that can be conducted using them.

Tools and resources submissions need to be available for testing. Further, they need to be accompanied by a paper, which must adhere to [CEURART submission formatting guidelines](https://ceurws.wordpress.com/2020/03/31/ceurws-publishes-ceurart-paper-style/). The length of the paper should be at most 5 pages, everything included (references etc.).

The paper should contain at least the following parts:

- Title, authors, and affiliations;
- An abstract (of no more than 100 words);
- An introduction section, which, among others, should highlight the significance of the tool or resource to the BPM field;
- A section discussing the innovations of the tool or resource to the BPM community and its main characteristics or features;

For tool demonstrations:

- A section describing the maturity of the tool. For this section, one could provide a brief description of case studies performed using the tool, provide scalability data or pointers indicating where readers can find more information about these case studies;
- A link to a video that screencasts and demonstrates the tool, preferably including voice, which must not be longer than 4 minutes;
- A link to the tool (e.g., a link to a web page where to download or use the tool). If the tool requires a license, a paper’s or tutorial’s appendix should describe how to obtain a (temporary) license. The procedure to obtain the license must not disclose the identity of the reviewers. The appendix will not be included in the final version for the proceedings, if the demo is accepted. The reviewers must be able to execute and understand the tool, a short “get it started” is recommended.

For resource expositions:

- A section describing the data model and schema of the resource. The reader should understand from this section how to interpret and gather information from the exposed resource;
- A section describing a preliminary analysis conducted on, or with the aid of, the resource. For this section, it is necessary that the procedure to obtain the results is clearly linked to the exposed resource;
- A publicly accessible and persistently available link (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, Zenodo, B2share) to download and cite the resource. The web page must not require a registration procedure that unveils the identity of reviewers. In addition, it has to contain:
- Download, loading and usage instructions, and
- License specification.

## Submission and Review Process

Demo and resource papers should be submitted through the [BPM 2025 EasyChair submission site](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=bpm2025).

All demo and resource submissions will be reviewed by the Demos & Resources Program Committee. The Committee will also vote on the best contribution to receive the “BPM 2025 Best Demos and Resources Award”.

Accepted demo and resource papers will be submitted for publication to CEUR (indexed by DBLP and SCOPUS) and posted along with their videos on the BPM 2025 web page.

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact: i.m.beerepoot@uu.nl.

## At the Conference

At least one author of the paper is required to register, attend the conference, and present the tool or resource during the Demo & Resources session.
