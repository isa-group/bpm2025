## Aim and Scope

The Process Technology Forum invites submissions on technical and engineering aspects related to the study, design, development, and maintenance of software systems that support the modeling, simulation, analysis, enactment and monitoring of business processes, “process systems” in short. 

Process systems are a fascinating technology as they combine advanced computer science methods and techniques with real-world applications that impact nearly every industry.  Process systems sit at the heart of modern applications helping enterprises to streamline their business operations, enhance process efficiency, and respond to the needs of ever-changing markets.

Process system engineers face complex challenges such as developing flexible modelling frameworks that can capture diverse processes and complex process dependencies in business operations. They also develop simulation tools to test these processes under different scenarios, providing valuable insights into resource allocation, bottlenecks, and process optimization. Process systems often incorporate advanced analytics to track performance, allowing for the real-time monitoring of processes, the detection of inefficiencies, and data-driven improvements. The enactment component needs to be able to handle large numbers of concurrently executed processes efficiently, securely, and reliably. It further requires a seamless integration with various enterprise software systems, ensuring that processes align across all organizational functions. As organizations increasingly adopt AI-driven automation, process systems are evolving to support automated decision-making, predictive analytics, and self-optimization. Additionally, process systems are increasingly designed for cross-organizational scenarios, requiring engineers to address scalability, security, privacy, and fault tolerance across multiple servers, ensuring high availability.

The Process Technology Forum provides a platform for discussion and introduction of new research ideas related to the technical and engineering aspects of process systems. Relevant topics include, but are not limited to:

### Process implementation and automation

  * Robotic Process Automation (RPA)
  * Blockchain and process systems
  * Process systems and IoT
  * Digital twins and processes
  * Cloud-based process systems
  * Service-oriented architectures and microservices

### Process systems architectures
  * Systems architectures of process systems
  * Design methodologies for process systems
  * Testing process systems
  * User-centered design and user interfaces
  * Process engine architectures and process orchestrations
  * Process choreographies, distributed and federated process systems
  * Mobile access to process systems, mobile processes
  * Scalability, robustness and reliability
  * Applying DBMS methods and techniques to process systems
  * Applying software / service engineering principles to process systems
  * Verification tools for process systems

### Process systems and AI
  * Chatbots for interacting with process system components
  * Using Large Language Models for generating process models
  * Integrating process systems with symbolic AI & machine learning
  * Fairness, explainability and adoption of intelligent process systems

### Process repositories and warehouses
  *  Process querying, process query languages
  *  Indexing process data
  *  Architectures for process repositories and warehouses
  *  Business process analytics and business analytics
  *  Archiving process-related data

### Security and privacy
  * Modelling of Security and Privacy concerns of processes
  * Security concerns in process systems architectures and realizations
  * Security violations detection and reaction
  * Privacy preserving process systems
  * Identity Management
  * Access control mechanisms

### Application domains for process systems
  * Process systems in Manufacturing, Healthcare, Logistics, Smart home, etc.
  * Process systems for scientific workflows
  * Case studies and lessons learned

## Paper Submission

Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished papers within the forum’s topics. Papers must be written in English and cannot be simultaneously submitted to other journals or conferences. The maximum length of the paper is 15 pages in total, including figures, tables, references, etc. Shorter papers are welcome as well.

Submissions must be prepared according to the format of Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing (LNBIP) specified by Springer. The title page must contain a short abstract and a list of keywords, preferably inspired by the list of topics above. Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format via the [BPM 2025 EasyChair submission site](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=bpm2025) by selecting “BPM 2025 Process Technology Forum”.
