The winner is also offered the option to publish the dissertation thesis in Springer’s LNBIP series.

## Nomination and submission

Candidates are nominated by their primary supervisor using a nomination letter.
Each professor is only allowed to nominate one candidate. The candidate is responsible for submitting the nomination material
via Easychair. Online submissions can be done via the BPM 2025 EasyChair submission site by selecting
[“BPM 2025 Dissertation Award”](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=bpm2025) as Track. A submission must include the following documents as a single PDF file:

1. 5-pages extended abstract (in [CEUR format](https://ceurws.wordpress.com/2020/03/31/ceurws-publishes-ceurart-paper-style/))

2. Nomination letter by supervisor (not longer than 2 pages)
3. PhD evaluation report including the reviews of the dissertation
4. CV of the candidate including publication list
5. Full document of the dissertation.

We plan to publish all extended abstracts that are relevant to this call as a volume of CEUR
online proceedings.

## Selection process

The winner of the award will be determined in two steps. First, a review committee will evaluate the submission material and
identify a short list of three candidates. Second, these three candidates will be invited to give a presentation of their work
in an online session with the review jury. The jury will then select the winner.
The selection process will be directed by the following criteria:

* Originality and depth of contribution
* Methodological soundness
* Form and quality of presentation
* Significance for the research field
