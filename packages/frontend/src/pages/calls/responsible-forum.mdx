Business Process Management (BPM) is concerned with the design, analysis and management of business processes (Dumas et al. 2018). Traditionally, BPM has emphasized efficiency and effectiveness as the core ambitions of organizational work. In light of the many societal and environmental challenges we are facing today, this forum fosters academic exchange around Responsible Business Process Management (RBPM). 

We define RBPM as the practice of applying BPM by accounting for the needs of stakeholders involved in business processes (e.g., workers, and customers), the broader environment (e.g., regulators and natural resources) and society in more general terms (e.g., grand challenges). RBPM can pertain to different activities, such as responsibly designing, implementing and monitoring business processes, as well as developing and using BPM systems in responsible ways. Along these lines, RBPM can be realized to different degrees. At least, RBPM accounts for relevant needs by not producing harm; but it can also imply intentional pursuit of positive effects, such as by pro-actively promoting the well-being of workers and customers, fostering sustainability or addressing societal concerns. 

RBPM faces challenges from three perspectives—technological, managerial, and conceptual. From a technological standpoint, issues arise around data security, privacy, and the ethical use of AI and automation. The integration of these technologies often involves handling sensitive information, raising concerns about transparency, accountability, and algorithmic bias. In terms of managerial issues, there is a challenge in aligning organizational goals with ethical and sustainable practices, as managers should balance efficiency and profitability with social responsibility. This often includes navigating regulatory requirements and maintaining stakeholder trust. From a conceptual angle, there is the difficulty of embedding ethical principles into BPM frameworks, as traditional models are often focused on efficiency and cost-effectiveness rather than ethical outcomes. Defining and measuring "responsibility" in processes, as well as understanding the long-term impact of decisions on society and the environment, further complicate the development of a truly responsible BPM approach.

The forum is intended to discuss topics of responsibility along various stages in the BPM lifecycle–including responsible analysis, design and performance, affecting computational as well as managerial sides of BPM.

This forum will be structured into invited talks, paper presentations, and an activity involving the audience, such as a panel. Since RBPM represents a new and only broadly defined effort in the BPM field, we explicitly encourage researchers and practitioners to jointly shape the future of this emerging research stream. We invite submissions in the form of full and statement/point of view papers.

## Topics
The forum invites contributions related to RBPM, including, but not limited to, the following topics:
- Ethical challenges in process automation and AI integration. 
- Data privacy and security in BPM.
- Fairness and bias in BPM algorithms. 
- Explainability and Transparency in BPM Technologies.
- Sustainable Process Design and Optimization.
- Incorporating Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) into BPM.
- Algorithmic Accountability in Process Mining and Analysis.
- Embedding Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in BPM. 
- Defining and Measuring Responsibility in BPM Systems. 
- Ontological Aspects of RBPM. 
- Responsible Management of Business Processes. 
- Regulatory and Compliance Considerations for RBPM. 
- Leadership and Managerial Roles in Promoting RBPM. 
- Measuring the Impact of RBPM Initiatives.
- Employee Engagement and Ethical Awareness in Process Management. 
- Employee Wellbeing. 
- Future Trends and Challenges in RBPM.      
- Gender aspects of BPM
- Inclusion and Inclusiveness of Employee Groups, Customer Types and Other Stakeholders

## Submission Guidelines
Prospective authors are invited to submit papers on any of the forum’s topics. We welcome submissions for both full papers and short papers to the R-BPM Forum. Authors are encouraged to contribute original, thought-provoking work, even if the research is ongoing. The submission types are as follows:

### 1 - Full Papers: up to 12 pages (including references).

Full papers should present theoretical advancements, case studies, or empirical work that addresses R-BPM from technological, managerial, conceptual, or ethical perspectives.

### 2 - Short Papers:  2 pages (including references).
Short papers may take the form of “Statement Papers” or “Point-of-View Papers”, similar to extended abstracts. These submissions are meant to capture innovative ideas, emerging concepts, or preliminary research findings. We strongly encourage the submission of early-stage work that presents a clear vision, hypothesis, or critical perspective on R-BPM topics, even if results are not yet complete.

Papers must be written in English and must not simultaneously be submitted to another journal, conference, or workshop.

Submissions must be prepared according to the format of Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing (LNBIP) specified by Springer. The title page must contain a short abstract and a list of keywords.
Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format via the [BPM 2025 EasyChair submission site](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=bpm2025) by selecting “BPM 2025 Responsible BPM (RBPM) Forum”. 

Accepted papers will be published in LNBIP as proceedings.
