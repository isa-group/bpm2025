## The Forum

Business Process Management (BPM) has become part of the curricula across a number of primary, secondary, professional, online, and in-company education programs.

The Educators Forum seeks to bring together educators within the BPM community for sharing resources for improving the practice of teaching BPM-related topics by exchanging experiences, bringing in cases, and discussing teaching innovations.

In this way, the Educators Forum also highlights the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) as part of the BPM teaching practice in regard to the systematic inquiry about student learning, the habits and skills of scholars to work as teachers, and the support for young lecturers to obtain their qualifications.

## Forum Topics

The Educators Forum aims to be the meeting point for sharing and improving our BPM teaching in a dynamic way, far from more traditional research contributions. That is why we are open to all kinds of contributions, such as sharing new techniques, lessons learned, methodologies, case studies, systematic studies, empirical experiments, resources, materials, and tools. Contributions are welcome in the fields of teaching BPM contents, evaluating BPM contents, and the use of technology as a facilitator of BPM education.

The topics of interest for the Educators Forum include, but are not limited to:

- New active learning methodologies for teaching BPM
- Design and implementation of new resources for teaching BPM
- Novel assessment instruments for BPM contents
- Feedback approaches tailored for BPM courses
- Teaching procedural thinking
- Systematic studies of BPM in different education dimensions
- Best practices and lessons learned for teaching BPM
