      <p><b>Josep Carmona</b> is a full professor of computer science at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC) and
      CEO of Process Talks, a company founded to empower people when they sit in front of a computer. As a researcher, he enjoys solving
      complex problems by connecting complementary disciplines—a habit that has led him to work in areas such as concurrent systems,
      VLSI, BPM, process mining, data science, natural language processing, and generative AI. Josep co-authored the book
      Conformance Checking (Springer, 2018) and co-edited the Process Mining Handbook (Springer, 2022), the latter of which is one of
      the most downloaded books in the field of process mining today.</p>
      <br />
      <p>As an entrepreneur, he is building a technology company amidst the unprecedented revolution brought on by the disruption of
      generative AI. This exciting journey is filled with lessons learned and best practices that Josep plans to share
      with the BPM community in this keynote.</p>
