        Our welcome reception will be held in the former Royal Tobacco Factory, a magnificent 18th-century stone
        building that was Europe’s first tobacco factory and a masterpiece of industrial architecture from the Old Regime.
        Featuring elegant courtyards adorned with marble fountains, this historic site now serves as the rectorate of
        the University of Seville.

        On Tuesday, we will enjoy a private guided visit to the Real Alcázar of Seville, a breathtaking
        palace originally built by Moorish Muslim kings and considered one of Spain’s most beautiful landmarks.
        As Europe’s oldest royal palace still in use, its upper levels serve as the official Seville residence of
        the Spanish royal family. The palace is also home to stunning gardens, featuring Moorish and Renaissance designs,
        tranquil ponds, exotic trees, and picturesque pavilions. Together with the Cathedral of Seville and the
        General Archive of the Indies, the Alcázar is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

        To close the conference, we’ll gather on Thursday evening at La Raza Puerto, a lively restaurant by the 
        Guadalquivir River. We’ll kick off with a cocktail and some light food in a relaxed setting, followed by 
        drinks and music to celebrate the end of the main conference days. It will be a great moment to unwind, 
        chat with other participants, and enjoy a fun evening together in one of Seville’s most pleasant riverside 
        venues.
