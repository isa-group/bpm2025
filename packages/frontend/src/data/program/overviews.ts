          <br /><br />
          Business process monitoring involves tracking and analyzing operational business processes to
          gain insights into their performance, identify bottlenecks, and facilitate that they are running efficiently.
          This tutorial introduces the participants into how modern AI methods can be employed to realize
          predictive as well as prescriptive business processes monitoring.
          Where predictive monitoring helps to answer “what will happen and when?”,
          prescriptive monitoring allows answering “when to intervene and how?” Together, these monitoring
          approaches assist process managers and operators in deciding on when and how to intervene during an ongoing
          business process in order to prevent or mitigate the occurrence of an undesired process outcome.
          The tutorial introduces the participants to advanced deep learning methods for business process
          monitoring: deep supervised learning for predictive monitoring, and deep reinforcement learning for
          prescriptive monitoring. The tutorial positions these deep learning methods within the overall
          framework of business process monitoring systems and explains how deep learning helps to address key
          challenges. It presents empirical results on the effectiveness and cost savings of these
          deep learning methods, which are distilled into a set of recommendations for selecting
          appropriate deep learning methods in practice. Finally, the tutorial provides an outlook on future
          directions in AI-assisted business process monitoring, particularly elaborating the opportunities
          introduced by large language models (LLMs) and the need for explainable AI (XAI).

        description: `
          <i>Alessandro Gianola, Andrey Rivkin and Mateusz Slazynski</i>
          <br /><br />
          Formal methods have always been an integral part of the BPM lifecycle. They are mathematically
          grounded techniques used to specify and analyze complex systems with a high degree of precision.
          In BPM, they help ensure that processes are correctly specified and capable of achieving the intended
          outcomes, by detecting design flaws and verifying compliance with defined goals.
          Among these techniques, the Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) stands out as a powerful
          approach to specifying and solving problems with clearly defined constraints. CSP techniques are known
          for their high performance, yet a major barrier to broader use lies in the difficulty of defining
          suitable encodings, which require expert knowledge. Nevertheless, modern tools have made substantial
          progress in improving CSP accessibility for non-experts. In this tutorial, we define CSP, motivate its use
          in BPM, and showcase how two CSP instances, one over Boolean and the other over structured domains,
          can be used to solve BPM analysis problems via suitable encodings. Such encodings will be demonstrated
          during hands-on sessions with the help of state-of-the-art CSP tools. As a key learning outcome,
          participants will gain a deeper understanding of CSP-based formal methods and their integration into
          process analysis.

          <br /><br />
          Business Process Optimization (BPO) concerns making optimal operational decisions
          during process redesign or process execution—such as task assignment, resource allocation,
          resource staffing, and case advancement (e.g., admitting a patient). These decisions must balance
          objectives like cost, time, and satisfaction while respecting constraints like availability,
          deadlines, and budgets often under uncertaitny. Though related to Prescriptive Process Monitoring (PrPM),
          BPO addresses constrained combinatorial problems that often exceed real-time capabilities.
          This tutorial introduces key BPO problem types and solution approaches,
          illustrating specific problem-solution pairs that were already explored.
          While not exhaustive, the classification aims to provide a structured overview and spark future
          research in this emerging area.
