        <p>We are Process.Science, a Hamburg-based company transforming the landscape of process analytics since 2019.
        Our core innovation lies in making sophisticated process analysis accessible by integrating process mining capabilities
        directly into widely used business intelligence tools like Microsoft Power BI, Tableau and Qlik Sense.</p>

        <br />

        in process mining forms the basis of our scientific approach. Through our partnerships with international universities and
        continuous research-based development, we bridge the gap between academic excellence and practical
        business applications in process management.</p>

        various industries identify and optimize their critical business processes. We invite you to explore
