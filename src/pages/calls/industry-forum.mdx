Join the global BPM community by contributing to the upcoming Industry & Society Forum at the 2024 International Business Process Management Conference, set to take place in the enchanting city of Sevilla from 1st to 5th September 2025.

The BPM Industry & Society Forum has emerged as a significant platform for bridging the gap between academia and industry and the public sector, fostering meaningful connections among BPM experts worldwide. It is the ultimate gathering for BPM professionals to interact with leading academic thought leaders at the International Conference on Business Process Management, a prestigious event with a tradition spanning over two decades. This year, the forum has decided to highlight the importance of process-oriented technologies at large, broadening its scope to the value of BPM in societal challenges.

The BPM Industry & Society Forum’s primary focus is on showing cutting-edge real-world experiences leveraging BPM for improvement and innovation across various sectors, regions, economies, and societies. Your valuable insights and success stories are sought after to enrich the discussions at this pivotal event. Our audience comprises professionals including business analysts, process managers, chief information officers, chief operations officers, digital transformation managers, project managers, process architects & consultants, industry researchers, service providers, and process scientists. This diverse mix ensures a multifaceted approach to BPM, both in business improvements and in the creation of robust digital societies. We encourage practitioners to share their experiences and viewpoints in their BPM endeavors. Collaboration with academics is also encouraged, and if you are seeking academic partners, we are here to assist you in finding the right fit. Participating in the Industry & Society Forum means your work will be meticulously reviewed for potential inclusion in the conference proceedings, gaining widespread recognition and exposure. Case studies written by service providers and BPM vendors only and without the involvement of the case organization are not desired.

Examples of questions we would like to jointly find answers to include:
- How to utilize new technologies for process innovation?
- How to deliver strategic value through BPM?
- How to build a process-oriented organization?
- How to create a successful BPM governance that balances stability and efficiency with innovation and localization?
- How to leverage and coordinate BPM within large, global initiatives?
- How to leverage BPM techniques in addressing global challenges such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals?
- How to apply BPM technologies for the common good?
- How to leverage BPM within small organizations and startups?
- How to manage the change that is unleashed by BPM initiatives?
- How to design robust and agile processes in light of external change?
- How to co-improve cross-organizational processes with business partners?
- How to implement cutting-edge technologies to optimize business processes, e.g., agentic information systems or large language models, Robotic Process Automation or artificial intelligence solutions, action-oriented or object-centric process mining, or distributed ledger technologies?
- How to drive digital innovation with and through BPM efforts?

Organizations are invited to submit their articles and present them at the BPM conference. We are, among others, interested in cases that demonstrate the application of new technologies such as Robotic Process Automation, Process Mining, Internet of Things, Blockchain, Virtual/Augmented Reality, Predictive Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, Building Information Models, Digital Twins, Smart Devices, etc. to illustrate what business process management can deliver in practice.

Don’t miss this exceptional opportunity to be part of the BPM community’s premier event. Your expertise and insights can make a significant impact on the future of BPM. Join us in Sevilla in 2025!

Offer a brief overview of the broader context in which the contribution unfolds. This could include relevant industry trends, challenges, or opportunities that set the backdrop for the specific situation being examined.

### Research / Methodological Background
It is necessary to place this problem in a scientific/research context. Embedding this problem in a scholarly context could involve situating it within a selected framework or Business Process Management (BPM) theory.

### Key Findings or Outcomes
Provide key findings, outcomes, or insights that will be explored in the paper. This helps to engage the reader and sets expectations for what they can learn from the analysis.
